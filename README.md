# AutoFixture.Community.FSharp

This is a small library that builds on top of [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) to add support for F#-specific types. 
Specifically, the important additions that are't currently handled well with vanilla `AutoFixture` are: 

1. Discriminated Unions
2. F# lists

Everything else seems to work pretty well out of the box.
